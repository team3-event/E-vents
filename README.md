## Conflict Plan

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**  

Bring up any issues in the group slack or talk to someone one-on-one if needed. Open lines of cummunication. Everyone is learning and be understanding of that. If anyone is having issues solving things alone we can use partner programming or sharing screens to figure it out together.  

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**  
Let them know to delegate tasks more and that they're taking over a bit too much. It's a team effort.  

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?** 

Everyone is learning and be understanding of that. If anyone is having issues solving things alone we can use partner programming or sharing screens to figure it out together. People choosing tasks that they are comfortable with, don't necessarily have to complete an equal amount.  

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**  

Offer to help or change the way were programming together. Don't call them out in the group setting, just offer to help out if you notice something or talk it over with the person.  

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**  

Team meeting/ intervention.

## Our pitch

To create a site that aggregates data that can be shared with friends to plan for events. Things like links to tickets, accomodation, flights, and weather during the event.  

**What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail.**  

It can be difficult to keep friends in the loop when trying to plan events and go on trips. This can create an easy place for everyone to stay updated and plan for the planned trip.  

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?**  

We would like a user to be able to search for an event or city and the weather, hotel, event info, and transportation info be displayed.  

## Domain Model 

![invision board](./Class%20files/readmeimages/Invision%20Board.png)

## User Stories

1. A user wants to find future events in an area that they're planning to visit. So they use the site to plan.

2. A user is bored and looking for something to do with friends so they use the site to find an event and book a hotel for the night.

3. A user is trying to plan the cost of a trip and uses the site to price out the price of travel and accommodation.  

4. A user already has plans but they are wondering what the weather will be like during that event.  

5. A user would like a place to keep track of upcoming trips with friends and to have that data all stored in one place.  

## Database Schema Diagram

![Schema layout](/Class%20files/readmeimages/Mongo%20DB%20Schema%20plan.png)
The event data will be stored for each user as a collection. As well as a collection for the groups of users that would like to be associated with each other.
